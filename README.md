# Design Co Coding Challenge

**Author:** Zachary Huang

## Overview
This project demonstrates my solution for the Design Co Software Developer Challenge. It showcases an interactive, dynamic mock webpage that explains what a few common types of coffees are.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important Notes
- Planning and ideation sketches are included in `/docs`.
- Built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
