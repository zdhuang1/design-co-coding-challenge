    nav2: { heading: "Cappuccino", body: [
      "Cappuccino is a classic Italian favorite, composed of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. Its balanced layers offer a creamy texture with a strong coffee presence, making it a staple for morning rituals and a symbol of Italian café culture.",
      "The drink’s name derives from the brown robes of the Capuchin friars, whose color inspired the name cappuccino, meaning “little hood” in Italian."

    nav3: { heading: "Latte", body: [
      "Latte, features a shot of espresso blended with a large volume of steamed milk, in a 1:2 ratio, with a thin layer of foam on top. The result is a smooth, mild, and creamy drink, ideal for those who enjoy a less intense coffee flavor with a comforting mouthfeel.", 
      "While latte comes from the Italian term caffè latte, meaning \"coffee with milk,\" the modern latte is mainly an American invention evolved from European coffee traditions.",

    nav4: { heading: "Americano", body: [
      "Americano is a go-to for connoisseurs who appreciate the bold character of espresso in a more approachable, diluted form. It's made by adding hot water to one or two shots of espresso, traditionally in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a smooth, full-bodied coffee with a rich flavor and a light crema on top.",
      "The history of the Americano is rooted in WWII, where American soldiers diluted espresso to closer resemble the drip coffee they were used to drinking back home.",
